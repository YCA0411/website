        For all the times that you rained on my parade
        And all the clubs you get in using my name
        You think you broke my heart, oh, girl, for goodness' sake
        You think I'm crying on my own, well, I ain't

        And I didn't wanna write a song
        'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care, I don't, but
        You still hit my phone up
        And baby, I'll be movin' on
        And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
        Maybe you should know that

        My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
        And I never like to admit that I was wrong
        And I've been so caught up in my job
        Didn't see what's going on, but now I know
        I'm better sleeping on my own

        'Cause if you like the way you look that much
        Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
        And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
        You should go and love yourself

        But when you told me that you hated my friends
        The only problem was with you and not them
        And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
        And tried to make me forget where I came from

        And I didn't wanna write a song
        'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care, I don't, but
        You still hit my phone up
        And baby, I'll be movin' on
        And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
        Maybe you should know that

        My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
        And I never like to admit that I was wrong
        And I've been so caught up in my job
        Didn't see what's going on, but now I know
        I'm better sleeping on my own

        'Cause if you like the way you look that much
        Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
        And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
        You should go and love yourself

        For all the times that you made me feel small
        I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
        I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
        Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

        'Cause if you like the way you look that much
        Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
        And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
        You should go and love yourself

        'Cause if you like the way you look that much
        Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself (yeah)
        And if you think (you think) that I'm (that I'm)
        Still holdin' on to somethin' (holdin' on, no)
        You should go and love yourself
